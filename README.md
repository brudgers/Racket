  * Language: ISL
  
  * Functions for sorting (listof Image) by area and perimeter. 
  
  * Boxes image to data structure (make-graphic pic area perimeter)
  
  * Illustrates some abstraction for helper functions

The idea of using a data structure to add key values came about because I recently started grazing volume 3 of TAOCP. One of the first exercises is about randomizing a set of records and Knuth mentions adding temporary keys to records and then discarding the keys after they have done their work.
